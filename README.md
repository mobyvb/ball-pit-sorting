# Ball Pit Sorting
A useful, everyday script to help you sort ball pits

With this script, you can be productive, and sort ball pits! By running the script, a random interval between thirty and sixty minutes is picked. At the end of this interval, an air raid siren is played. This means to start sorting. You have five minutes until you hear "The test is over", after which you get back to being productive (shoutout to The Flaming Lips for providing me with that sample).

There is also a public webpage at http://mobyvb.com/ball-pit-sorting that runs this script in the browser. Be prepared for loud sirens if you visit that page.
